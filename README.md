 ● Developed a full-stack web application utilizing the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js,
 React.js, Node.js) stack with OAuth 2.0 authentication, enabling users to securely sign in
 with their Google accounts.
 ● Implemented a role-based access control system, differentiating between "Creator" and
 "Student" roles. Creators have the privilege to upload and post learning videos, while
 students have access to view the posted videos.
 ● Designed and implemented a hierarchical data structure to support infinite threaded
 comments on the posted videos, ensuring a seamless and organized discussion
 experience for users.
 ● Leveraged AWS services, specifically S3 bucket and CDN, for efficient storage and
 delivery of uploaded videos and images. Implemented the use of Pre-Signed URLs to
 allow direct uploads to the S3 bucket, eliminating the need for backend server
 involvement and ensuring optimal performance
